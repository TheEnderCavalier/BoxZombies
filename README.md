# BoxZombies
A tiny project that I made during my programming class to reinforce my basic coding skills and learn Github.

BoxZombies is a game about zombies and colored gems.
It's something I'm quite proud of for my skill at the time.

In the game, you fight through waves.
Each wave consists of the opening of a box and gem looting (gain), a zombie survival (fight), and a potential boss (boss).
By the end of the wave, you will either gain or lose ammo.
There's no way to win, but not losing for a while involves getting a good gem upkeep and tons of ammo.
