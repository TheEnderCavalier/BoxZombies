# BoxZombies
A tiny project that I made during my programming class about zombies and colored gems.
Can you get the fabled everstone and set a high score?

In the game, you fight through waves. Each wave consists of the opening of a box and gem looting (gain), a zombie survival (fight), and a potential boss (boss). By the end of the wave, you will either gain or lose ammo. There's not way to win, but not losing involves getting a good gem upkeep and tons of ammo.
